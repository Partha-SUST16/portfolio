### What is the purpose of this PR

- This PR fixes the flaky test  `org.apache.commons.collections4.bag.CollectionBagTest.testCollectionToArray2`
- The mentioned test may fail or pass without changes made to the source code when it is run in different JVMs due to `HashMap`'s non-deterministic iteration order.

### Why the test fails
- As the `CollectionBagTest` uses `HashBag` as its `collection` which uses `HashMap` internally and as per `Java 8` documentation, the ordering of `HashMap` is not constant, so assigning the same hashmap as an array to different objects can change the ordering. So when comparing these two arrays with `assertEquals` the test may fail as their ordering can be different.

### Reproduce the test failure
- Run the test with 'NonDex' maven plugin. The command to recreate the flaky test failure is 
  ` mvn -pl . edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:1.1.2:nondex -debug -Dtest=org.apache.commons.collections4.bag.CollectionBagTest#testCollectionToArray2`

- Fixing the flaky test now may prevent flaky test failures in future Java versions.

### Expected result
- The tests should run successfully when run with 'NonDex' maven with the same command for recreating the flaky test.

### Actual Result
- We get the failure:
    `[ERROR] org.apache.commons.collections4.bag.CollectionBagTest.testCollectionToArray2  Time elapsed: 0.025 s  <<< FAILURE! junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: toArrays should be equal expected:<[10, 6.0, 11, 4, Seven, Eight, 5.0, 15, 2, 12, 16, Thirteen, null, , Three, Nine, One, One, 14]> but was:<[, null, Seven, 2, 5.0, 12, 10, 11, 14, 16, One, One, Nine, Eight, Thirteen, 15, 4, 6.0, Three]>
`
### Fix
- Override the `getIterationBehaviour()' method from `AbstractCollectionTest` and return `UNORDERED` in `CollectionBagTest`.
